# Overview

This folder contains the raw wind tunnel data for the MXS.

Files are typically named in the format: `{name}_{airspeed}_{rig_pitch}`.

Airspeed control was generally relatively relaxed (tunnel was faulty) so error bars on airspeed may need to be wide.

## PWM mapping

For all runs, PWM to surface angle mapping is as below:

Aileron
Elevator
Throttle
Rudder


## 2021-11-03 & 2021-11-04

These folders contain data from static tests conducted on a thrust stand in the tunnel return section.

See notes.txt for order of runs (under day 1)

`as10`, `as12.5` and `as15` contain data from 10m/s, 12.5m/s and 15m/s respectively.

## 2021-11-17

See notes.txt for order of runs (under day 2)

## 2021-11-18

Data with prop removed. Tare at start and likely at end of day
